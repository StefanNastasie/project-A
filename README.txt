Note: you need python < 3.10 for this to work - some of the dependencies are not compiled for python 3.10 yet.
3.9 is recommended.

You need to install the requirements with:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

If pip is not found, you need to add the scripts folder of the python installation you're using to the system
environment variables.

Note this work is very rough, there is a lot to improve.
See main.py for an example and explanation of possibilities.
