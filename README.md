# Project-A
 
Note: you need python < 3.10 for this to work - some of the dependencies are not compiled for python 3.10 yet.
Python 3.9 is recommended.

# Summary

The project currently consists of two main facets: a neural network trained on crypto price data, which is integrated with a framework which allows for performance analysis, and data visualisation.

at the bottom of main.py you can choose whether you want to train, or test a trained model. 

When training a model you will be asked to describe the model. This will be the name of the model, which you can then use to access the same model/weights when trying to test it.
